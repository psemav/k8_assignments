ReplicaSet
1. "kind" is different, "selector" is a little bit different. RC for some reason defines port but RS does not.
2. ok.
3. kubectl get rs; kubectl get po;
4. Applied services NodePort and ClusterIP. Both services are bale to pick up the web-service within the pods.
5. After changing label of a pod, the pod is no longer treated as a part of the RS. The RS starts new pod so the desired number of pods remain the same.

CronJob
1. ok.
2. done.
3. CJ applied.
4. kubectl get cj
5. When the scheduled time comes, new pod is created. When the job is done, the pod remains in Completed status.
6. kubectl patch cj batch-job-every-fifteen-minutes -p "{\"spec\" : {\"suspend\" : true }}"
7. Job is a one-time action, cronJob runs repeatedly (indefinitely).
